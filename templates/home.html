  <h3>Welcome to a world limited only by your Imagination.</h3>
  <p>Diabolic: Arcane Oddessy is a Table-Top Role-Playing-Game system that focuses on ease-of-access for new and veteran players alike. The game is designed to be simple yet flexible, allowing players to create nearly any kind of character imaginable without having to worry about minute details and rules. While other games have a plethora of class choices to make the game more dynamic, D:AO has only four professions. These four choices provide a simple framework for the character, allowing the player to further customize their character however they please.</p>

  <h3>Current Development Progress</h3>

<div class="CurrentDevelopment">


  <p><b>Combat</b> - Combat progresses like a narrative in real time, very similar to games like "Dungeon World." A series of basic actions describe nearly any action a player may take during a "combat" sequence. Typically, each player is allowed a single action before they are interrupted by an enemy, but it is the Host's job to make sure that combat feels smooth, and realistic. The goal is to avoid the feeling of being in a turn-based game.</p>
<p><b>Arcanists & Spiritualists</b> - Magic users in the game can fall into many categories, but the two main forms of magic are Arcane and Spiritual. Arcane magic focuses around complex sequences and mathematics to channel the energy emanating directly from the sun (and other astral bodies) to create magical effects. Spiritual magic draws upon the influence and power of the spirits in many forms, including ancestors and "deities", depending on who you ask. There is no restriction on using the two magics together, however in some cases the spirits involved may disagree with your actions.</p>
<p><b>Prerequisites & Restrictions</b> - Players can wield any weapons and cast any magic, however the effectiveness of both come into question when your stats are not sufficient. A player may spend the points to learn a powerful spell early in the game, however their skill levels may not be high enough to have a high chance to safely cast it. The result is a last-ditch-effort spell which could result in an epic save, or a dramatic death. The same concept is applied to weapons. A player can wield any weapon, even if it is too heavy for them or they have never held a weapon like it before, however they will suffer penalties to its effectiveness. This way, in most cases, using the equipment and spells within your capabilities are always more effective and reliable.</p>
<p><b>Professions</b> - Classes in Diabolic have been renamed to Professions as I feel they more accurately portray their value. There are four Professions to choose from: Warrior, Arcanist, Spiritualist, and Jack. As there are no prerequisites, the profession you ultimately decide on will not limit your options the same way as other games might. Instead, choosing your profession effects two key things.
  <ul>


<li>First, you gain a 2 point discount to all skills in your related profession. Skills are worth 2 + their level, meaning all level 1 skills are worth 3 at their base. This means when you select a profession, all level 1 skills now only cost 1 point. Level 2 costs 2, and so on.</li>
<li>Second, whenever you gain a level, you gain an additional bonus unique to your Profession. Warriors gain +1 Advantage (ability to win priority when clashing actions with an enemy), Spiritualists and Arcanists have better chances to cast spells successfully, and Jacks gain +1 to each of their 5 chosen General Skills (more on that later.)</li></ul>
When leveling up Warrior, or Combat skills, you must have purchased the level before the one you're trying to purchase to access it. When leveling up Arcanist or Spiritual skills (spells) you can select from any of the available options, regardless of whether you have purchased lower levels. The trade-off is that those higher level spells will very likely be impossible to cast safely, so it is often a poor investment.</p>
<p><b>XP, Skill Points, & Leveling Up</b> - Leveling up in Diabolic is designed to be quick and easy, intended to be done on the fly, and sometimes even in the middle of combat if it's appropriate. When players preform notable actions, win a particularly tough fight, or complete a quest, they are awarded XP. XP is only given out in small handfuls, 1 or 2 points at a time. When a player earns XP, they mark down how much more they need to collect in order to level up (7 XP to advance to level 2). At the same time, each time a player earns XP, they also earn Skill Points. These skill points may be spent immediately. (I'm still debating whether or not you should be forced to spend them for game balancing. You'd be able to put points into very expensive things gradually if that was the case, but I want to avoid confusing micromanaging as much as possible for the sake of the players.)</p>
<p><b>General Skills & Jacks</b> - General Skills are very important in defining the abilities of your character. Each General Skill is already tied to a base Stat (Strength, Endurance, etc.) so players can attempt to use a skill even if they don't have any points in it. Some skills are labeled as Advanced skills. These skills require an investment of points at creation in order to use them. How much you need to invest is dependent on how high your related Stat is. Advanced skills cannot be learned on your own, so the only time you can put points into them is during creation or when you have access to a sufficient trainer. (Another player can teach you as well.)</p>
<p>Jacks are a new Profession I created as a replacement to the popular Thief or Bard classes. In fact, Jacks pick up the slack for just about any preferred playing style if the other three Professions don't fit your needs. When you pick a Jack (short for Jack of all Trades) as your profession, you select 5 General Skills to represent your profession. As an example, a Thief might have Stealth, Lock-picking, Forgery, Climbing, and Acrobatics as their 5 skills. Since a Jack doesn't get any discounts like the other Professions do, instead, they get a +1 bonus to each of their chosen skills for each level they have. This means that even if the Jack doesn't distribute points among their main 5 skills, those skills will still improve with them. The bonus points a Jack earns from levels does NOT effect the price of a skill, so there is no penalty for waiting to put points into those skills.</p>
<p><b>Character Traits</b> - Most important to character development are Character Traits. Players decide on their Traits before they even choose their profession. Here, a player can decide what sort of talents or challenges they will have to face. Each Trait has a Positive and Negative version as well as a Greater and Lesser version of both. When one is picked, the other logically cannot be picked anymore. Each trait has a numerical value that is added to a total when selected. Negative traits and Positive traits are added to separate totals, however the value of both MUST be equal and neither must exceed 15 points. Players do not have to keep purchasing until they reach the 15 point maximum, however they must purchase at least 2 points worth of traits on both sides. The idea here is to allow players to have major bonuses at the cost of major negatives.</p>
<p>This step is very important for all characters, and especially so the Jack. Here, a Jack can decide he wants to be just as skilled as a Warrior is at fighting. The bonus is a costly one, (10 positive points) however it gives the Jack a 2 point discount to all Warrior skills, just like a Warrior. The difference is now he has to balance out those 10 positive points with 10 points of negative traits, and he does not get the level up bonus that Warriors do. Still, this means he will progress in combat skills considerably faster throughout the game.</p>
<p>Additionally, a Warrior himself might decide to pick that trait. In his case, he already has a 2 point discount for being a Warrior by profession. Should he pick the trait, this means his discount will be increased to 4 points, meaning the first two levels of all Combat skills will be below 1 point in cost. As the cost is below 1, the player automatically acquires these skills. This can be an incredibly powerful move, but often results in your character having some nasty negative traits. Still, those negative traits can be a source of fun and good role-play.</p>
<p><b>The World</b> - I won't go into too much detail about the game world I've been working on at the moment as so much of it is still subject to change, but know that I intend provide a game world with tons of flexibility to play around with for homebrew games and campaigns. In the distant future I'll have full modules and the like, but for now I'm just focusing on fleshing out a universe and its history.</p>
